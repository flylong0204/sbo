# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-Test-Needs: perl-Test-Needs (skip tests when modules not available)
perl-Test-Needs:
perl-Test-Needs: Skip test scripts if modules are not available. The requested modules
perl-Test-Needs: will be loaded, and optionally have their versions checked. If the
perl-Test-Needs: module is missing, the test script will be skipped. Modules that are
perl-Test-Needs: found but fail to compile will exit with an error rather than skip.
