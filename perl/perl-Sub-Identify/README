Sub::Identify allows you to retrieve the real name of code references. For
this, it uses perl's introspection mechanism, provided by the B module.

It provides four functions : sub_name returns the name of the subroutine (or
__ANON__ if it's an anonymous code reference), stash_name returns its package,
and sub_fullname returns the concatenation of the two.

The fourth function, get_code_info, returns a list of two elements, the package
and the subroutine name (in case of you want both and are worried by the
speed.)

In case of subroutine aliasing, those functions always return the original
name.
