# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-Moose: perl-Moose (postmodern object system for Perl 5)
perl-Moose:
perl-Moose: Moose is an extension of the Perl 5 object system.
perl-Moose: The main goal of Moose is to make Perl 5 Object Oriented programming
perl-Moose: easier, more consistent, and less tedious. With Moose you can think
perl-Moose: more about what you want to do and less about the mechanics of OOP.
perl-Moose: Additionally, Moose is built on top of Class::MOP, which is a
perl-Moose: metaclass system for Perl 5. This means that Moose not only makes
perl-Moose: building normal Perl 5 objects better, but it provides the power of
perl-Moose: metaclass programming as well.
