# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-Guard: This module implements so-called "guards". A guard is something
perl-Guard: (usually an object) that "guards" a resource, ensuring that it is
perl-Guard: cleaned up when expected. Specifically, this module supports two
perl-Guard: different types of guards: guard objects, which execute a given code
perl-Guard: block when destroyed, and scoped guards, which are tied to the scope
perl-Guard: exit.
