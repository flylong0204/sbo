# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-Eval-Closure:
perl-Eval-Closure: String eval is often used for dynamic code generation. For instance,
perl-Eval-Closure: Moose uses it heavily, to generate inlined versions of accessors and
perl-Eval-Closure: constructors, which speeds code up at runtime by a significant amount.
